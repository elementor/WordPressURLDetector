# WordPress URL Detector

A library to get all public URLs from a WordPress application.

---

Still in early development. Started from URL detection code within [wp2static](https://github.com/leonstafford/wp2static)
 and will be first used there when ready. Should be useful for any other WP static site generators to use, along with
 any projects requiring WordPress URL detection, such as 404 checkers.

## Installation options

 - via [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) `composer require leonstafford/wordpressurldetector`
